# Contract Management System

## Overview
Contracts are managed directly within the `tenants` table using embedded contract fields. There is no separate contracts table - all contract information is stored alongside tenant data.

## Contract Fields in Tenants Table
- `contract_start_date` - When the contract begins (usually same as rent_start)
- `contract_end_date` - When the contract expires
- `contract_duration_months` - Total contract length in months (default: 6)
- `contract_status` - Current contract state
- `completed_cycles` - Number of paid billing cycles completed

## Contract Status Values
- `active` - Contract is currently valid and tenant is paying
- `renewed` - Contract has been extended/renewed
- `expired` - Contract end date has passed
- `terminated` - Contract ended early (move-out, violation, etc.)

## Key Files
- [app/api/contracts/renew/[tenantId]/route.js](mdc:app/api/contracts/renew/[tenantId]/route.js) - Contract renewal
- [app/api/tenants/[id]/paid-cycles/route.js](mdc:app/api/tenants/[id]/paid-cycles/route.js) - Cycle tracking
- [app/api/payments/route.js](mdc:app/api/payments/route.js) - Updates completed_cycles

## Billing Cycle Tracking
1. Each paid bill increments `completed_cycles` counter
2. Progress is displayed as "completed_cycles/contract_duration_months"
3. Early termination threshold: Less than 5 completed cycles
4. Normal termination: 5 or more completed cycles

## Contract Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: New tenant gets 6-month contract by default
2. **Active Period**: Tenant pays monthly bills, cycles increment
3. **Renewal**: Extends contract_end_date and increases total duration
4. **Completion**: Move-out process based on cycle completion status

## Business Rules
1. Contract duration can be renewed/extended multiple times
2. Early termination (< 5 cycles) forfeits security deposit
3. Normal termination (â‰¥ 5 cycles) allows full deposit refund
4. Contract status determines available tenant actions
5. Completed cycles reset only on new tenant, not on renewal
