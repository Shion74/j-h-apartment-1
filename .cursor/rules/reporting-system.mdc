# Reporting System Architecture

## Monthly Reports
Monthly financial reports are based on:
1. Billing cycles ending in the month
2. Payments received during the month
3. Separate income/expense tracking

## Key Components
- [app/api/reports/monthly/route.js](mdc:app/api/reports/monthly/route.js) - Monthly report generation
- [app/api/dashboard/stats/route.js](mdc:app/api/dashboard/stats/route.js) - Dashboard statistics
- [app/api/payments/stats/route.js](mdc:app/api/payments/stats/route.js) - Payment analytics

## Data Sources
Reports combine data from:
- Active bills and bill_history
- Active payments and payment_history
- Tenant records (active and archived)
- Contract information

## Financial Categories
1. Income
   - Room rental revenue
   - Extra fees collected
   
2. Expenses
   - Electricity charges
   - Water fees

3. Net Income
   - Total Income - Total Expenses

## Report Generation Rules
1. Reports auto-update when month changes
2. All calculations use tenant billing cycles
3. Revenue is based on payment dates
4. Bills are counted based on rent_to dates
5. All monetary values must be properly parsed as floats
6. Totals must include both active and archived records
