# Billing Reminders System

## Overview

The billing reminder system automatically sends email notifications to `official.jhapartment@gmail.com` for bills that are due within 3 days or are overdue. This helps management stay on top of collections and ensures no bills are forgotten.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies bills due within 3 days or overdue
- **Daily Notifications**: Sends consolidated email with all bills needing attention
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents sending multiple reminders for the same bill on the same day
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Includes bill details, tenant information, and recommended actions
- **Statistics Tracking**: Maintains records of sent reminders for reporting

## How It Works

### Email Trigger Conditions
Emails are sent for bills that meet ANY of these criteria:
- Due today (0 days remaining)
- Due within 1-3 days
- Overdue (past due date)
- Partially paid bills that are due soon or overdue

### Email Content
Each reminder email includes:
- Summary statistics (total bills, total amount, overdue count)
- Bills grouped by due date
- Individual bill details (tenant, room, branch, amount)
- Color-coded urgency indicators
- Recommended actions for management

### Frequency
- **Daily**: One email per day (if there are bills needing attention)
- **Time**: Recommended to run at 9:00 AM daily
- **Deduplication**: Won't send duplicate reminders for the same bill on the same day

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The system requires two additional database tables that are automatically created:

```sql
-- Email notifications tracking
CREATE TABLE email_notifications (
  -- ... (automatically created)
);

-- Billing reminders tracking  
CREATE TABLE billing_reminders (
  -- ... (automatically created)
);
```

### 2. Email Configuration
Ensure your email settings are configured in the admin panel:
- SMTP Host, Port, Username, Password
- From Email Address
- Test the email configuration before setting up reminders

### 3. Manual Triggering
You can manually trigger billing reminders from:
- **Dashboard**: Click "Send Reminders" button in the Billing Reminders panel
- **API**: POST request to `/api/bills/reminders`

### 4. Automated Scheduling (Optional)

#### Option A: Manual Script Execution
Run the script manually when needed:
```bash
node scripts/run-billing-reminders.js
```

#### Option B: Cron Job (Linux/Mac)
Set up a daily cron job to run automatically:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && node scripts/run-billing-reminders.js >> logs/billing-reminders.log 2>&1
```

#### Option C: Windows Task Scheduler
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger to "Daily" at 9:00 AM
4. Set action to start program: `node`
5. Add arguments: `scripts/run-billing-reminders.js`
6. Set start in: `C:\path\to\your\project`

## Usage

### Dashboard Interface
1. Go to the Dashboard
2. Look for the "Billing Reminders" panel
3. Click "Send Reminders" to manually trigger

## Email Sample

**Subject**: `Billing Reminder - 5 Bills Due Soon`

- Recommended actions for management

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Statistics
- Dashboard shows recent reminder activity

### Troubleshooting
1. **No emails received**: Check email configuration in admin panel
2. **Duplicate emails**: System prevents this automatically
3. **Missing bills**: Verify bill due dates and status
4. **Script errors**: Check logs and database connectivity

### Maintenance
- Old reminder records are automatically cleaned up after 90 days
- Weekly cleanup runs on Sundays when using the script
