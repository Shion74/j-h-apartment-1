# Tenant Management System Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the tenant management system to implement advanced deposit handling and move-out processes according to specific business rules.

## Key Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Advance Payment Rules

### 3. Contract Management
- **Renewal Option**: Tenants can renew contracts for 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 months
